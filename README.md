# Norlin Book Lookup Mobile Application


## Project Description

We are building a web application that works on iOS and Android browsers and what it is, is a book finder for the Norlin library. Users type in a book name and their phones will use the built-in gyroscope to present an augmented reality map to guide the users to their book.


## Vision Statement 

**"A personal librarian, finding books made easy, all just on your phone."**


## Motivation

We thought it would be great if we could find books more easily in Norlin Library


## Risks

Some risks are that we are exposed to new languages such as Javascript, MySQL, PHP.

### Mitigation strategy for risks

Generalize the location of books. Simple code. One function, does one job, and does it well. 


## Requirements

### User requirements
- As a student, I want an easy way to find book. Time: 9weeks
- As a user, I want the app to be conveient. Time: 9weeks
- As a user, I want the instructions to be clear. Time: 9weeks

### Function Requirements
- As developers, we need a database to store our data. Prority:1
- As developers, we want to be able to search for books on our database. Prority:2
- As developlers, create a route to the desired book. Prority:3
- As developers, allow navigation starting at several positions by showing a 360 degree view of the library. Prority:5
- As developers, we need to have a user-interface for the user to search for books. Prority:8

### Non-Functional requirements
- As a user, I want auto complete to help me find books faster. 
- As a developer and user, we want the panoramics to be clear. 
- As a user, I want the app to load fast. 
- As a user, I want auto-smooth transitions to different maps. 


## Methodology

Iterative process, with working new big features every 1-2 weeks.
